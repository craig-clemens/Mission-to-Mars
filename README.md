# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

Here we were tasked to build a web application that scrapes websites for data about the Mission to Mars, displaying the information and images in HTML format.

Using Jupyter Notebook, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, Pandas and MongoDB to scrape, organize and store our data we then use Python, HTML, Javascript, MongoDB and Flask to visualize it.
